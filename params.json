{"name":"Tubecast","tagline":"Convert a YouTube channel into a local RSS source for a podcast app to pickup.","body":"### What is TubeCast?\r\nTubeCast is a python program to convert YouTube videos into RSS feeds designed to be picked up by your podcasting app on your phone or in iTunes. TubeCast then locally hosts an address for you to type into your podcasting app, and it will sync up.\r\n\r\n### Why would I want to listen to videos?\r\nSometimes you don't have time to sit down and watch a long YouTube video of a movie review or talk. You would like to, but the only time you really have is on the way to work on a bus or train. The problem: you get motion-sickness, so you're limited to podcasting*. Or, you can't afford the data costs, since the YouTube app won't cache videos.\r\n\r\nTubeCast allows you to download YouTube videos onto your local computer, and then host them as a podcast RSS feed. You can use any podcast app on your phone (with all its bells-and-whistles) to copy the audio or videos from your computer. So long as your computer and phone are on the same network, there will be no data usage. Then you can consume the media you want when you can!\r\n\r\n*\"Limited to podcasting\" is a misnomer, because podcasts are great!\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nAt the moment, use pip install -r requirements.txt to get the right packages, and then add the YouTube URLs to the \"Videos to download.txt\" file (one URL per line). Then run:\r\n    python main.py\r\n\r\nYou can also get some quick help by doing:\r\n    python main.py  --help\r\n    usage: main.py [-h] [--no-youtube] [--no-rss-generating] [--no-hosting]\r\n    \r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help           show this help message and exit\r\n      --no-youtube         Skip the YouTube part of TubeCast.\r\n      --no-rss-generating  Don't generate any rss feeds for existing files.\r\n      --no-hosting         Don't host the rss files on a local server using Flask.\r\n\r\nMore options will be added soon. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOlympusMonds\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
