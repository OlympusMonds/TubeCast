{"name":"Tubecast","tagline":"Convert a YouTube channel into a local RSS source for a podcast app to pickup.","body":"### What is TubeCast?\r\nTubeCast is a python program to convert YouTube videos into RSS feeds designed to be picked up by your podcasting app on your phone or in iTunes. TubeCast then locally hosts an address for you to type into your podcasting app, and it will sync up.\r\n\r\n### Why would I want to listen to videos?\r\n* A lot of content on YouTube does not necessarily require or use the visual aspect of the video,\r\n* The YouTube app does not continue to play content when the device is locked,\r\n* The YouTube app does not cache content, so once your out of home (and away from wifi), you need to use your mobile data.\r\n* Some of us cannot watch or read things while on public transport due to motion sickness. This allows longer content to be consumed in time that would otherwise be unusable.\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nGotta build it first!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOlympusMonds\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n - youtube-dl\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
