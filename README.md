# TubeCast
Convert a YouTube channel into a local RSS source for a podcast app to pickup.

## Important Note ##
This program no way intends to stop content creators receiving payment via ads (or whatever). While perhaps naive, the intent is to be able to consume their content in a more convienient way for those who either get motion-sickness on public transport, or can't afford the data costs of mobile YouTube.
I would recommend you look to see if the creator you're TubeCasting has a Patreon, or similar, to support them.

# TODO
 - Test out 3rd party library like youtube-dl to see how it works. Most likely will make your life 1e6 times easier
 - Flask is probably the easiest web-hoster for the RSS feed.
  - What does a podcast RSS feed look like?
 - Downloading ALL videos from a channel might be full on - need controls
 - Same for RSS feed - should all vids be put up?
  - Probably, podcast app can handle the amount it wants.
