# TubeCast
Convert a YouTube channel into a local RSS source for a podcast app to pickup.

## Important Note ##
This program no way intends to stop content creators receiving payment via ads (or whatever). While perhaps naive, the intent is to be able to consume their content in a more convienient way for those who either get motion-sickness on public transport, or can't afford the data costs of mobile YouTube.
I would recommend you look to see if the creator you're TubeCasting has a Patreon, or similar, to support them.

# TODO
 - Get Flask to have a state (or just make it search the filesystem all the time...)
